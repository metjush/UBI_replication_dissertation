Estimating the Effect of Basic Income on Entrepreneurship
=============================

Replication data and code for the dissertation (Matus Luptak)
------------------------

This repository provides the `Stata` code and source of data to replicate the empirical results of my MA Economics Dissertation on Basic Income and Entrepreneurship.

### Dissertation abstract
> This dissertation empirically investigates the hypothesis that a universal basic income would positively influence entrepreneurial activity. After reviewing the existing literature and noting the absence of an ideal dataset, it utilizes the _British Household Panel Survey_ data to estimate two models that are used as proxies for basic income; receipt of windfall income and the transition to retirement. The econometric analysis studies the dynamic relationship between the proxy experience and a transition into (new) self-employment. Results from the windfall model show only redundancy payments are a significant predictor of the transition. Retirement is shown to be a consistent positive influence on entrepreneurial entry. Both models are imperfect in approximating true basic income, and questions remain about the type of self-employment that people would transition into, but the empirical results show basic income could be expected to increase self-employment rates.
